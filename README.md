# Bowling Project #

This program is in response to Joe Hixson's code challenge to build a bowling program. Python is the language I chose
as that's what the position. 

### What is this repository for? ###

* Bowling code is found in app/bowling
* Version 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

Project was written with Python 3.8 as the interpreter

* There are no dependencies (hence no requirements file). To get setup, just clone and create a new venv
* To run the program, execute the following command from a terminal in the project root:
    python3 -m app.bowling.driver_bowling_game
* Alternatively, can be run with an IDE by running the driver_bowling_game.py file located at app/bowling/driver_bowling_game.py

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Owned by Larry Finch. Please send any questions to lfinch.slc@gmail.com
